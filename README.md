# The-Social-Loop ~ Social Network App

Social Loop is a JavaFX project, built for a univerisity course. Its purpose it's to allow users to create an account, log in and log out, search people from database, add friendships and delete them.

By starting the application, the costumer will have the option to log in to their account if they have one, using their username and password. If they don't have an account, they need to register to the "Social Loop" by submitting a form, by pressing on the "Register now" button which will redirect the costumer to a new window for the registration process.

Once logged in, the user can send friend request by searching usernames, accept friend request or deleting users from their friendlist.

The design of the Social Loop App is intended to remove any barriers to entry for potential users, allowing them to immediately begin engaging with the app's content and features, being simple and intuitive for everyone.
